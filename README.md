# Contact form - Responsive with HTML/CSS/JS !

![DESIGN-IMG](design/desktop-design.jpg)

## Overview

This small, but functional contact form was a fun project to start implementing a little bit of Javascript, which is a step-up from my previous html/css only projects! I learned quite a bit with this one. It's got a clean design and it's fully functional, and so I am satisfied with this one!

## Challenges Faced

- **Form Layouts** 
  I actually don't have much experience with form building prior to this challenge, this form is actually my first actual form that I've built from scratch! Although I have the knowledge to build it, putting the knowledge into practise was a different matter, but I'm glad I was able to do just that, with a bit of patience :D

- **JavaScript** 
  Since this is my first project where I actually implement some Javascript, instead of the usual HTML/CSS, it was still a bit time-consuming, as I hadn't developed the muscle memory for this. But I still managed to put my knowledge to practise and it turned out okay! Going forward, I am much more confident and I will continue to get better and faster.

## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **JavaScipt**
- **Responsive Design:** Leveraging `display`, `position`, and other CSS properties to create a fluid, adaptable layout, beyond just media queries.
- **Problem-Solving:** Drawing on previous project experience to solve new challenges.
